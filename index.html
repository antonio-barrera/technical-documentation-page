                        Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language.
                        Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its use of significant
                        indentation. Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach
                        aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale
                        projects.

                        Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple
                        programming paradigms, including structured (particularly, procedural),
                        object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a
                        "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.

                        Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s, as a successor
                        to the ABC programming language, and first released it in 1991 as Python
                        0.9.0. Python 2.0 was released in 2000 and introduced new features, such as
                        list comprehensions and a cycle-detecting garbage collection system (in
                        addition to reference counting). Python 3.0 was released in 2008 and was a
                        major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible.
                        Python 2 was discontinued with version 2.7.18 in 2020.

                        Python was conceived in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde &
                        Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC programming language,
                        which was inspired by SETL, capable of exception handling and interfacing with the
                        Amoeba operating system. Its implementation began in December 1989. Van Rossum
                        shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July
                        2018, when he announced his "permanent vacation" from his responsibilities as Python's
                        "benevolent dictator for life", a title the Python community bestowed upon him to
                        reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief decision-maker. In January 2019,
                        active Python core developers elected a five-member "Steering Council" to lead the project.

                        Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000, with many major new features, including
                        a cycle-detecting garbage collector (in addition to reference counting) for memory
                        management and support for Unicode.

                    <p>
                        Python 3.0 was released on 3 December 2008. It was a major revision of the language
                        that is not completely backward-compatible. Many of its major features were backported
                        to Python 2.6.x and 2.7.x version series. Releases of Python 3 include the 2to3 utility,
                        which automates the translation of Python 2 code to Python 3.

                        Python 2.7's end-of-life date was initially set at 2015 then postponed to 2020 out of
                        concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python
                        3. No more security patches or other improvements will be released for it. With Python
                        2's end-of-life, only Python 3.6.x and later are supported.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Python 3.9.2 and 3.8.8 were expedited as all versions of Python (including 2.7) had security
                        issues, leading to possible remote code execution and web cache poisoning.

                        Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. Object-oriented programming and structured
                        programming are fully supported, and many of its features support functional programming and
                        aspect-oriented programming (including by metaprogramming and metaobjects (magic methods)).
                        Many other paradigms are supported via extensions, including design by contract and logic
                        programming.

                        Python uses dynamic typing and a combination of reference counting and a cycle-detecting garbage
                        collector for memory management. It also features dynamic name resolution (late binding), which
                        binds method and variable names during program execution.

                        Python's design offers some support for functional programming in the Lisp tradition. It has
                        filter, mapandreduce functions; list comprehensions, dictionaries, sets, and generator
                        expressions.
                        The standard library has two modules (itertools and functools) that implement functional tools
                        borrowed from Haskell and Standard ML.

                            <code>print(number_list)</code>
                            <code>## Output = [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18]</code>

                    <p>
                        Python uses whitespace indentation, rather than curly brackets or keywords, to delimit blocks.
                        An
                        increase in indentation comes after certain statements; a decrease in indentation signifies the
                        end
                        of the current block. Thus, the program's visual structure accurately represents the program's
                        semantic
                        structure. This feature is sometimes termed the off-side rule, which some other languages share,
                        but
                        in
                        most languages indentation does not have any semantic meaning. The recommended indent size is
                        four
                        spaces.
                        <pre>

                            Addition, subtraction, and multiplication are the same, but the behavior of division
                            differs.
                            There are two types of divisions in Python. They are floor division (or integer division) //
                            and floating-point/division. Python also uses the ** operator for exponentiation.

                            From Python 3.5, the new @ infix operator was introduced. It is intended to be used by
                            libraries
                            such as NumPy for matrix multiplication.

                            From Python 3.8, the syntax :=, called the 'walrus operator' was introduced. It assigns
                            values
                            to
                            variables as part of a larger expression.

                        Methods on objects are functions attached to the object's class; the syntax
                        instance.method(argument) is, for normal
                        methods and functions, syntactic sugar for Class.method(instance, argument). Python methods have
                        an
                        explicit self
                        parameter to access instance data, in contrast to the implicit self (or this) in some other
                        object-oriented programming
                        languages (e.g., C++, Java, Objective-C, or Ruby).[96] Apart from this, Python also provides
                        methods, often called dunder
                        methods (due to their names beginning and ending with double-underscores), to allow user-defined
                        classes to modify how
                        they are handled by native operations such as length, comparison, in arithmetic operations, type
                        conversion, and many
                        more.

                    <p> Python uses duck typing and has typed objects but untyped variable names. Type constraints are
                        not
                        checked at compile time; rather, operations on an object may fail, signifying that the given
                        object
                        is not of a suitable type. Despite being dynamically-typed, Python is strongly-typed, forbidding
                        operations that are not well-defined (for example, adding a number to a string) rather than
                        silently
                        attempting to make sense of them.

                    <p>
                        Python allows programmers to define their own types using classes, which are most often used for
                        object-oriented programming. New instances of classes are constructed by calling the class (for
                        example, SpamClass() or EggsClass()), and the classes are instances of the metaclass type
                        (itself an
                        instance of itself), allowing metaprogramming and reflection.

                        Before version 3.0, Python had two kinds of classes: old-style and new-style. The syntax of both
                        styles is the same, the difference being whether the class object is inherited from, directly or
                        indirectly (all new-style classes inherit from object and are instances of type). In versions of
                        Python 2 from Python 2.2 onwards, both kinds of classes can be used. Old-style classes were
                        eliminated in Python 3.0.

                    <p>
                        The long-term plan is to support gradual typing and from Python 3.5, the syntax of the language
                        allows specifying static types but they are not checked in the default implementation, CPython.
                        An
                        experimental optional static type checker named mypy supports compile-time type checking.

                        Python has the usual symbols for arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), the floor division operator
                        //
                        and the modulo operation % (where the remainder can be negative, e.g. 4 % -3 == -2). It also has
                        **
                        for exponentiation, e.g. 5**3 == 125 and 9**0.5 == 3.0, and a matrix‑multiplication operator @
                        .[104] These operators work like in traditional math; with the same precedence rules, the
                        operators
                        infix (+ and - can also be unary to represent positive and negative numbers respectively).
                        <br>
                        The division between integers produces floating-point results. The behavior of division has
                        changed
                        significantly over time:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Current Python (i.e. since 3.0) changed / to always be floating-point division, e.g. 5/2 ==
                            2.5.
                        </li><br>
                        <li>Python 2.2 changed integer division to round towards negative infinity, e.g. 7/3 == 2 and
                            -7/3
                            == -3. The floor division // operator was introduced. So 7//3 == 2, -7//3 == -3, 7.5//3 ==
                            2.0
                            and -7.5//3 == -3.0. Adding from __future__ import division causes a module to use Python
                            3.0
                            rules for division (see next).</li><br>
                        <li>Python 2.1 and earlier used C's division behavior. The / operator is integer division if
                            both
                            operands are integers, and floating-point division otherwise. Integer division rounds
                            towards 0,
                            e.g. 7/3 == 2 and -7/3 == -2.</li>

                    <p>Python's large standard library, commonly cited as one of its greatest strengths, provides tools
                        suited to many tasks. For Internet-facing applications, many standard formats and protocols such
                        as
                        MIME and HTTP are supported. It includes modules for creating graphical user interfaces,
                        connecting
                        to relational databases, generating pseudorandom numbers, arithmetic with arbitrary-precision
                        decimals, manipulating regular expressions, and unit testing.
                        <br>
                        Some parts of the standard library are covered by specifications (for example, the Web Server
                        Gateway Interface (WSGI) implementation wsgiref follows PEP 333), but most modules are not.
                        They are specified by their code, internal documentation, and test suites. However, because most
                        of
                        the standard library is cross-platform Python code, only a few modules need altering or
                        rewriting
                        for variant implementations.

                        CPython is the reference implementation of Python. It is written in C, meeting the C89 standard
                        with
                        several select C99 features (with later C versions out, it's considered outdated; CPython
                        includes its own C extensions, but third-party extensions are not limited to older C versions,
                        can
                        e.g. be implemented with C11 or C++). It compiles Python programs into an intermediate
                        bytecode which is then executed by its virtual machine. CPython is distributed with a
                        large standard library written in a mixture of C and native Python. It is available for many
                        platforms, including Windows (starting with Python 3.9, the Python installer deliberately fails
                        to
                        install on Windows 7 and 8; Windows XP was supported until Python 3.5) and most modern
                        Unix-like systems, including macOS (and Apple M1 Macs, since Python 3.9.1, with experimental
                        installer) and unofficial support for e.g. VMS. Platform portability was one of its earliest
                        priorities, during the Python 1 and Python 2 time-frame, even OS/2 and Solaris were
                        supported; support has since been dropped for a lot of platforms.

                        Python's name is derived from the British comedy group Monty Python, whom Python creator Guido
                        van
                        Rossum enjoyed while developing the language. Monty Python references appear frequently in
                        Python
                        code and culture; for example, the metasyntactic variables often used in Python literature are
                        spam and eggs instead of the traditional foo and bar. The official Python documentation
                        also contains various references to Monty Python routines.

                        The prefix Py- is used to show that something is related to Python. Examples of the use of this

                        (commonly used to create games); PyQt and PyGTK, which bind Qt and GTK to Python respectively;
                        and

                    <p>Python can serve as a scripting language for web applications, e.g., via mod_wsgi for the Apache
                        web
                        server. With Web Server Gateway Interface, a standard API has evolved to facilitate these
                        applications. Web frameworks like Django, Pylons, Pyramid, TurboGears, web2py, Tornado, Flask,
                        Bottle and Zope support developers in the design and maintenance of complex applications. Pyjs
                        and
                        IronPython can be used to develop the client-side of Ajax-based applications. SQLAlchemy can be
                        used
                        as a data mapper to a relational database. Twisted is a framework to program communications
                        between
                        computers, and is used (for example) by Dropbox.

                        Libraries such as NumPy, SciPy and Matplotlib allow the effective use of Python in scientific
                        computing, with specialized libraries such as Biopython and Astropy providing
                        domain-specific functionality. SageMath is a computer algebra system with a notebook interface
                        programmable in Python: its library covers many aspects of mathematics, including algebra,
                        combinatorics, numerical mathematics, number theory, and calculus. OpenCV has Python bindings
                        with a rich set of features for computer vision and image processing.
